title: My journey in Open Source World so far!

**What is Open Source Software?**

**Open Source Software (OSS)** is a computer software whose source code is made publicly available for modification and enhancements. It is released under various licenses like MIT etc.

There are many ways to contribute to the open source. The first, and easiest, is to **use open source software**. 
Another is to **talk about how you're using it**. To top off the beginner's part is **to report bugs and the detail steps
to reproduce it**.

I was going through the <a href=" htps://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android" target="_blank">Fossasia's Open Event </a> android app and I found some missing feature. I asked them to solve that issue and they told me to make a pull request with the proposed changes. That was my _first contribution_ and that's how I was landed into the world of the open source. 

It's been a while now since I started contributing to the open source and so far I am loving the experience. 
The reason why I kept contributing more to the projects was the feeling of accomplishment when my _first pull request was merged_.
It makes me happier when millions of people use your few lines of code in their day to day life. 

Contributing to open source was little scary because of the version controlling issues which scare me even now but every time my commit gets merged the happiness is far beyond that.

Finding a bug was really very hard at first but over time when I explored and familiarised myself more with the project I got used to it. 

Reading an open source code automatically tends me to pick some good code practices while coding. It helped me to make my online presence. I got the practical knowledge of **version controlling systems**, **issue trackers**, **debuggers** etc.

Currently, I am contributing to the following organisations &mdash;

<a href=" htps://github.com/fossasia" target="_blank">FOSSASIA</a>, is a non-profit organisation supporting the community of Open Source developers and makers in Asia. I am contributing to their android application <a href=" htps://github.com/fossasia/open-event-android" target="_blank">Open Event</a> which can be used for browsing information about the event. The community is very supportive. Their gitter channel is always bubbling with people willing to help with everything.

<a href=" htps://github.com/zulip" target="_blank">ZULIP</a>, is a powerful open source group chat application. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, audible notifications, missed-message emails, desktop apps, markdown message rendering, and much more -- essentially everything one might want. I am contributing to the <a href=" htps://github.com/zulip/zulip-android" target="_blank">android version</a> of it.

<a href=" htps://github.com/systers" target="_blank">SYSTERS</a>, is the worldâ€™s largest email community of women in technical roles in computing and helps to find them their potential in code. It has multiple android projects in the field of women healthcare and safety. I am contributing to their applications <a href="https://github.com/systers/powerup-android" target="_blank">Powerup</a>, a female empowerment educational mobile game app that will allow young girls to learn about reproductive health and self-esteem by navigating the life of their avatar and <a href="https://github.com/systers/FirstAide-Android" target="_blank">FirstAide</a>,  a mobile app that PCVs can readily have accessible to report or gain information on Peace Corps Safety and Security procedures.    

So far the overall contribution to open source is very rewarding. I am looking forward to contributing to more organisations and various other projects.
